# MannAMadLibEndpoint

Project Description:
A MadLib application that will take in 10 words as inputs from the user and output a story

Instructions:
1. Download the files and put them in their own folder, open the folder in VS Code, and start debugging (F5)
2. Navigate to "http://localhost:5183/MadLib" for the default story (you may need to change the port if it's different on your system > see debug console)
3. Append URL with a name, adj, occupation, band name, adj, adj, noun, noun (plural), noun, and verb ending in -ing such as "http://localhost:5183/MadLib/Harman/sick/cop/Weezer/silly/strong/whistle/chocco-tacos/thicc/sleeping" for a customized story. (Make sure all 10 words are accounted for or it will not work- no more! no Less!)
4. Have fun!

Peer reviewed by Jessie Lamzon: The use of switch worked well for this project and i like how you did it.  I did not run with errors and followed the assigment requirements.  Cool how you added the default switch too.  Good job!
